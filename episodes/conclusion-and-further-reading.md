## Conclusion

Throughout this course we have walked you through providing data management plan services in your library. We began with an overview of DMPs, reviewed relevant resources, and shared tips for providing services to patrons. Finally, we offered suggestions on how to implement DMP services at your library.

Looking to the future, it is likely that DMP services will continue to be a growth area for libraries. The [2022 Nelson Memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-access-Memo.pdf) from the Biden White House will mandate sharing of federally funded research data and publications. This and similar federal policies will only fuel the movement towards open data, and, with it, the need for librarian support of data management and sharing.
